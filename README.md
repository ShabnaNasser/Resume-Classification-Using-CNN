## Convolutional Neural Network with Word Embedding Based Approach for Resume Classification

This project explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) combined with word embedding techniques for the classification of resumes. 
By leveraging CNNs, which are well-suited for capturing spatial relationships in data, and word embedding models such as Word2Vec or GloVe, which represent words as dense vectors in continuous vector spaces, we aim to achieve accurate and efficient classification of resumes into predefined categories or classes.

### Key Features:

**CNN Architecture:** Implement a CNN architecture optimized for text classification tasks, consisting of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract relevant features from word embeddings.
**Word Embeddings:** Utilize pre-trained word embedding models such as Word2Vec or GloVe to represent words as dense vectors, capturing semantic relationships and contextual information.
**Resume Classification:** Train the CNN model on a labeled dataset of resumes, with each resume belonging to a specific category or class (e.g., "Engineering", "Marketing", "Finance"). Evaluate the model's performance on unseen data using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
**Model Interpretability:** Explore methods for interpreting the CNN model's predictions, including visualization techniques to understand which parts of the resumes are most influential in classification decisions.

### Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for building and training the CNN model)
- NumPy, Pandas (for data manipulation and preprocessing)
- Word embedding models (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) for word embeddings
